The following ActionScript 3 code attempts to access a property of an object that might be null or undefined, leading to a runtime error:

```actionscript
var myObject:Object = getObject();
trace(myObject.someProperty);
```

This will throw a `TypeError: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference.` if `getObject()` returns null or undefined, or if `someProperty` does not exist on `myObject`.  The issue is exacerbated when dealing with asynchronous operations or data loading where the object's existence is not guaranteed.
