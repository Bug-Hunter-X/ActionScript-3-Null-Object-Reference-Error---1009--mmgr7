# ActionScript 3 Null Object Reference Error (#1009)

This repository demonstrates a common error in ActionScript 3: the null object reference error (#1009). It also shows how to properly handle this error to prevent runtime exceptions.

The `bug.as` file contains code that attempts to access a property of an object that might be null, resulting in the #1009 error. The `bugSolution.as` file provides a corrected version with appropriate null checks.

## Running the code

You will need an ActionScript 3 compiler (like the Adobe Flex SDK or Apache Flex) to compile and run these files.  You can also use an online ActionScript 3 compiler.
